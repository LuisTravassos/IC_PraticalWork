Optimized Transfer Learning for Machine Learning Models:
- Prepared and split the dataset for training and evaluation, adjusted size and balance for optimal transfer learning. 
- Utilized pre-trained architectures and optimized final layers with PSO algorithms. 
- Compared PSO with grid and random search for hyperparameter tuning. 
- Analyzed and visualized results, performed final performance evaluation on an independent test set, and presented findings. 
- Implemented using Python, Sklearn, SwarmPackagePy, and Keras, with deliverables including a report, slides, source code, results file, and final model.
